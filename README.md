## Contributing
Please do! Once I add tests and CI, it will run ESLint automatically. In the meantime, please make sure contributions pass the included .eslintrc rules (AirBnbâ€™s configuration).

To run locally, clone the project and run `npm link` from within the project directory. Then `scopen` will be available from the command line, linked to your local installation. `npm link` must be run again between changes.
