## Contributing
Please do, especially to add support for other git remotes. AirBnbâ€™s ESLint rules are checked as part of the test suite, so make sure your editor is set up to respect the provided .eslintrc (or at least run `npm test` before pushing).

To run locally, clone the project and run `npm link` from within the project directory. Then `scopen` will be available from the command line, linked to your local installation. `npm link` must be run again between changes.
